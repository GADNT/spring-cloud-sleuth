/**
 * The Trace class is the primary way to interact with the library. It provides methods to
 * create and manipulate spans.
 *
 * A 'Span' represents a length of time. It has many other attributes such as a name, ID,
 * and even potentially a set of key/value strings attached to it.
 *
 * Each thread in your application has a single currently active currentSpan associated
 * with it. When this is non-null, it represents the current operation that the thread is
 * doing. Spans are NOT thread-safe, and must never be used by multiple threads at once.
 * With care, it is possible to safely pass a Span object between threads, but in most
 * cases this is not necessary.
 *
 * A 'TraceScope' can either be empty, or contain a Span. TraceScope objects implement the
 * Java's Closeable interface. Similar to file descriptors, they must be closed after they
 * are created. When a TraceScope contains a Span, this span is closed when the scope is
 * closed.
 *
 * The 'startSpan' methods in this class do a few things:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Create a new Span which has this thread's currentSpan as one of its parents.</li>
 * <li>Set currentSpan to the new Span.</li>
 * <li>Create a TraceSpan object to manage the new Span.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Closing a TraceScope does a few things:
 * <ul>
 * <li>It closes the span which the scope was managing.</li>
 * <li>Set currentSpan to the previous currentSpan (which may be null).</li>
 * </ul>
